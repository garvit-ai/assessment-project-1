                    <h5>WHERE WE STARTED</h5>
                    <p>In 1965, there were just three gyms for the 7 million people in the Los Angeles area and real strength training was nearly unknown. Enter Joe Gold, a Merchant Marine veteran with an impressive physique and film-extra roles in The Ten Commandments and Around the World in 80 Days.Fitness First purchased an abandoned lot on Pacific Avenue and erected a simple cinder-block building which he stocked with weight lifting equipment he built himself. Fitness creations were superior to anything on the market and were precursors to the equipment now standard in any good weight room. The first Fitness First was born and bodybuilders began to flock to it.</p0>

                    <h5>GAINING MOMENTUM</h5>
                    <p>Perhaps Fitness First most famous original member was Arnold Schwarzenegger. He and his group led the bodybuilding movement into the ‘70s with Fitness First at the forefront. Soon, the now iconic yellow Fitness First T-shirts were everywhere, signifying those who wore it were part of something bigger. In 1977, Fitness First hosted the Mr. America contest and that same year the movie Pumping Iron came out, featuring Schwarzenegger and his friends training for the Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia contests. The movie was a hit and vaulted Schwarzenegger – and Fitness First– to another level of celebrity.</p0>

                        <h5>A NEW ERA.</h5>
                        <p>By 1980, Fitness First ownership had changed hands a few times, landing with Pete Grymkowski, Tim Kimber and Ed Connors. The trio, nicknamed “The Three Horsemen,” set about spreading the core message of the brand to the nation. By 1981, many independent health clubs across the country were converting to Fitness First and the brand went international in 1985, opening in Canada. By 1993, there were 1 million members and in 1996 came expansion to Europe and Asia.

An evolution of offerings continued with the rise of the cardio age. Fitness First began offering community-based fitness classes from yoga to Zumba to Pilates. .</p0>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Q:How many hours do i have to spend in gym?</h2>
                <p>The most important thing is that your overall program and individual exercises are designed to meet your fitness goals and needs. That being said, we do recommend setting a time limit for your gym sessions. For the average gym goer the average session should be anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Q: Calories are burned while walking  one mile? </h2>
                    <p>Running burns more calories per minute than walking, but it's harder to keep the high-intensity for a long time. There is a 〜30% difference in calorie burn between a slow walk and a moderate run for the same distance. Further increases in running speed won't cause a dramatic increase in calories burned</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Q:How often should I workout?</h2>
                    <p>If you're just starting your fitness journey, don't stress too much about how often you are working out. Three to four times a week may be ideal, but once a week is WAY better than none a week. If you can do a full-body workout two to three times a week, awesome! You'll be rocking and rolling on your fitness journey.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>Q:Best exercise for fast results?</h2>
                    <p>Big, strong, full body movements by far outstrip any other kind of exercise. Combine it with high intensity interval training and you have a recipe for some devastatingly good body shape change.you lose very little fat, and you will put the water weight back on once you start to eat normally again.</p>
